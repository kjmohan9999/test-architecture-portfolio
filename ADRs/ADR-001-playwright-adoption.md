3. Find any repository with ADRs
4. Read ONE complete ADR
5. Notice:

   - How they list alternatives
   - How they explain consequences

**Example 2: Another Test Automation ADR** (5 min)
1. Search GitHub: `ADR selenium OR test automation`
2. Find a different example
3. Read it
4. Compare to the first one - similarities?

**Example 3: Quick Browse** (5 min)
1. Go to: https://adr.github.io/
2. Click "Browse examples"
3. Skim 2-3 different ADRs
4. Notice the patterns

## ❓ Got Questions?

**Common Day 1 Questions**:

**Q: "Should I use Notion or GitHub?"**
A: Notion if you want easy/fast. GitHub if you want professional/long-term. Can't go wrong with either!

**Q: "My template looks different from examples"**
A: That's fine! Templates vary. As long as you have Context, Decision, Alternatives, Consequences.

**Q: "I don't fully understand ADRs yet"**
A: Normal! It clicks when you write your first one. Tomorrow you'll start writing and it'll make sense.

**Q: "Can I skip ahead to Day 2?"**
A: Yes! If you're energized, keep going. But Day 1 alone is a solid start.

**Q: "I spent more than 1 hour"**
A: Also fine! First time setup takes longer. Tomorrow will be faster.
